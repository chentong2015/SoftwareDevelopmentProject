Ask correct questions ? 提恰当的问题
- 提问的问题一定是要和设计题目相关的 !!
- 设计的component也一定要和题目要求的相关，不要使用多余的，不适合的设计 !!
1. Who is the users are ?
2. What are the main features of the system ? The Top features to build ?
3. Functional requirements ? Follow RestFul APIs convention !
4. Do not introduce too much details until we have a full picture of design !


TODO. Use cases: How will the API/Service be used ？
Functional Requirements:
  - Searching Service: Search doctors
  - Booking Service: Book + Reschedule + Cancel + View
Non-functional requirements:
  - Low latency: searching less than 1s
  - High available: user can access services at anytime and from everywhere
  - High reliable(safety): all booking information will never be lost
  - High consistent: share same information between mobile and web

TODO. Math 数据计算: API服务需要支撑多大的并发量 + 需要多大的数据存储空间
1. The amount of traffic the system should handle
2. The amount of data the system should work with
