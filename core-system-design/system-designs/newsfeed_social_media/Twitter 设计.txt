Design Twitter Social Media:

1. Clarifying Questions
- 10 million users
- 10 million tweets per day
- 20 million tweet likes per day
- 100 million HTTP requests to the site
- 2 billion “follow” relations
- Some users and tweets could generate an extraordinary amount of traffic

2. High-level Design
- handle all incoming requests to the application
  - posting new tweets / writing
  - following a user / writing
  - liking a tweet / writing
  - displaying data about users and tweets / reading
- data storage to store all the data
  - each request will create queries to run

3. Low-level Issues

4. Additional Considerations
