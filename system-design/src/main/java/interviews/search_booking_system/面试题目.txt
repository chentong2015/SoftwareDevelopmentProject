Design a system that allows patients to search for and book a practitioner.
The system should handle searching for doctors based on location, specialty, and availability.
It also needs to support booking, rescheduling, and canceling appointments.

TODO. 1. Requirements Gathering 根据题目选择适当的提问
1. Support Web and Mobile UI ?
2. We don't need to login for searching, but booking ?
3. Support to find/view scheduled appointments
4. availability=3? Search from today to 3 days later

Functional Requirements: Two core services
- Searching Service: Search doctors
- Booking Service: Book + Reschedule + Cancel + View

Non-functional requirements:
- Low latency: searching less than 1s
- High available: user can access services at anytime and from everywhere
- High reliable(safety): all booking information will never be lost
- High consistent: share same information between mobile and web

TODO. 2. High-level Design 设计整体的框架，三层基本架构
- UI Layer
- Backend Service layer
- Underlying Database layer

TODO. 3. Deep into system 完善框架细节，自顶向下设计
- Load Balancer / Duplication
- REST API
- Caching
- ORM Engine
- DB Schema / DB backup

TODO. 4. Scalability / Estimation
- Hash Consistent
- Service Discovery
- Scalability: 分布式系统的服务可扩展性
- Caching Details: 缓存设计的细节
- DB Duplication / Data Sharding 数据库的查分问题
> Request Estimation 用户请求量的估计
> Table Estimation 数据表存储的估计

TODO. 5. Optimization / Improvements
- Monitoring: 服务的监控
- Automated Testing: 服务的自动化测试

TODO. 6. Sum up 简单的总结
- Known Issue 讨论系统中已知的一些问题
